# Coffee-website
HTML (index.html):
The basic structure of the website, including sections for the navbar, hero image with a call-to-action (CTA) button, featured products, coffee education section, and footer.
The hero section includes a background image and a CTA button that triggers a JavaScript function when clicked.
CSS (styles.css):
Basic styling for layout and visuals, including background images, text styles, buttons, and hover effects.
The hero section has a background image (coffee-hero.jpg), and the product cards have rounded corners and are responsive.
Flexbox is used to arrange product cards in a row, making the layout more flexible and responsive on different screen sizes.
The footer section has links for social media, and the hover effects make them interactive.
JavaScript (script.js):
A simple function showMessage() is used to display an alert when the "Explore Coffee" button is clicked, offering an interactive experience for users.
